# PRODIGY_WD_01: Interactive Landing Page

This repository contains my submission for **Task 01** of the Web Development Internship at **Prodigy InfoTech**. The objective was to create a responsive landing page featuring an interactive navigation menu.

## 🚀 Project Overview
The project is a modern, high-performance landing page for a fictional brand, **PRODIGYDEV**. It focuses on a "sticky" navigation experience where the UI adapts dynamically to user interaction and scroll behavior.



## ✨ Key Features
- **Dynamic Navigation Bar:** - Starts as transparent with white text for a clean "Hero" look.
  - Switches to a solid white background with dark text upon scrolling (detected via JavaScript).
  - Includes an "Anti-Blending" Get Started button that maintains high contrast in all states.
- **Smooth Interaction:**
  - Implemented `scroll-behavior: smooth` for internal page navigation.
  - Hover effects on menu items with animated underlines.
- **Modern About Section:**
  - Features a grid-based layout with an "Experience Badge" and feature-driven icon boxes.
- **Fully Responsive:** - Optimized for Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop using CSS Media Queries.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML5:** Semantic structure.
- **CSS3:** Custom properties (variables), Flexbox, Grid, and Backdrop filters.
- **JavaScript:** DOM manipulation and Scroll Event Listeners.
- **Google Fonts:** 'Poppins' for modern typography.
- **FontAwesome:** Scalable vector icons.
